# Project Title

## Quick Demos 

This project includes quick demos for sparse Principal Component Analysis (sPCA) and sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (sCCA). To run these demos, you can use the following scripts:

- `demo_sPCA.m`: For sparse Principal Component Analysis
- `demo_sCCA.m`: For sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis

## Proposed Algorithms

This project introduces two new algorithms, which are implemented in the following scripts:

- `SA_TPM.m`
- `SA_PGSA_ML.m`

### Associated Files

The following associated files are required to run the algorithms:

- `TPower_modified.m`
- `SGEP_PGSA_M.m`
- `sa_partial.m`
- `sa_partial_SGEP.m`
